## 📝 Project Overview

This project implements **Markowitz Portfolio Theory** by applying **mean-variance optimization** to help users achieve the highest possible return while minimizing risk.  
We employ **Markowitz** and **Target Return** strategies to ensure optimized asset allocation with the lowest risk levels achievable through these strategies. 

---

## 🛠 Key Features

- **Optimal Portfolio Weights**: Using historical data, the app calculates the best asset allocation that minimizes the portfolio's risk for a given return.

- **Risk-Return Tradeoff**: The tool helps you understand the balance between risk and return, offering insights into efficient frontiers and the capital market line.

- 🎯 **Target Return Strategy**: Allows investors to set a target return, and the app calculates the necessary portfolio weights and amount to achieve it with the minimum risk.

- 📊 **Markowitz Strategy**: Focuses on creating the minimum-risk portfolio given expected returns and variances of assets.

---

## 💡 Why Markowitz?

The Markowitz Model revolutionized investment management by introducing the concept of diversification.  
It shows that investors can reduce risk by carefully selecting a mix of assets, even if those assets have different returns, correlations, and volatilities.
